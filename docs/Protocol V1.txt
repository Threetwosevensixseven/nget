PROTOCOL V1

Minimum viable protocol for NGET to download itself. Full package functionality in V2 or above.

Server listens on TCP port
Client connects to listening port
Server hands off to new TCP port
Client sends:

PR_REQ_CHECK_PACKAGE
Client to server
01 VER (B1)
NN CSUM (B1) XOR of CSUM_SEED, VER

Server validates
If valid, server sends:

PR_RSP_CHECK_PACKAGE
Server to client
01 VER (B1)
NN CSUM (B1) XOR of CSUM_SEED, VER, FILELEN and FILE
NNNN FILELEN (B2)
NNNN FILE (B<FILELEN>)

Server closes connection immediately
Client downloads, closes connection, validates, and saves file
Details TBC, but initial client will download straight to RAM buffer, limit FILELEN to buffer size, and use hardcoded path and filename.
